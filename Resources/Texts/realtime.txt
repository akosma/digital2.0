While there are those who consider the iPad a direct descendant of printed media (papyrus > printing > electronic ink), we think that the iPad is much more than an electronic version of a hardcopy newspaper.

The iPad not only allows for distributing contents interactively, offering an outstanding user experience, but also enables the dissemination of information, updated in real time and adapted to the location, the user and the context.

The iPad is not just a newspaper, neither merely a splendid support for surfing the Internet, or a game console: it combines the best of these worlds and makes it possible to imagine new applications.
