While there are those who consider the iPad a direct descendant of printed publication (papyrus > printing > electronic ink), we consider that the iPad is much more than an electronic version of a hardcopy newspaper.

Not only does the iPad allow for disseminating contents interactively, thus offering an out-of-the-ordinary user experience, but it also permits the dissemination of information updated in real time and adapted to the place, the user and even the needs.

The iPad is not just a newspaper, not merely a splendid support for surfing the Internet and not a game console: it combines the best of all these worlds and makes it possible to imagine new applications.
